# My Chrome Dashboard

Super simple Google Chrome browser extension that turns your new tab screen into your personal dashboard. Pulls weather data, shows you a calendar, saves your notes. Great for keeping tabs (get it?) on stuff to do/watch/read later and copy/pasting chunks of text between devices. Saves the text as soon as you make edits.
